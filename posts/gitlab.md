## Adding an Existing Project to GitLab

To add an existing project to GitLab, follow these steps:

1. **Stage all files for the initial commit:**
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

2. **Commit the staged files:**
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

3. **Add the remote repository:**
    Replace `<access-token-name>` and `<access-token>` with your GitLab access token details.
    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://<access-token-name>:<access-token>@gitlab.com/myuser/myrepo.git
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use:
    ```sh
    git remote add source https://gitlab.com/akhil018/zktecoprogrammingchallenge.git
    ```

4. **Create and switch to a new branch:**
    ```sh
    git checkout -b "branch"
    ```

5. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
    ```sh
    git push
    ```

By following these steps, you can easily add your existing projects to Git and GitLab. Whether you are using GitHub or GitLab, initializing a repository, committing your work, and pushing it to a remote repository are essential steps for effective version control.
